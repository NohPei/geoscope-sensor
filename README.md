# [GeoMCU](https://github.com/NohPei/GeoMCU) Firmware

Arduino® firmware for running [GeoMCU](https://github.com/NohPei/GeoMCU) receiver boards.

In-depth documentation is included with the [GeoMCU Documentation](https://geomcu.readthedocs.io)

## Building

This project is set up to be compiled and flashed using [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), whether through the IDE or the core CLI.

Building with the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) should be possible, but is unsupported.
Doing so would require manually installing libraries and some modifications to link with the included `lib` folder.
